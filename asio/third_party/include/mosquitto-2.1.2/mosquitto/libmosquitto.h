 * Topic: Threads
 *	libmosquitto provides thread safe operation, with the exception of

 *
 *	If the library has been compiled without thread support it is *not*
 *	guaranteed to be thread safe.
 *
 *	If your application uses threads you must use <mosquitto_threaded_set> to
 *	tell the library this is the case, otherwise it makes some optimisations
 *	for the single threaded case that may result in unexpected behaviour for
 *	the multi threaded case.

/***************************************************
 * Important note
 *
 * The following functions that deal with network operations will return
 * MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, but this does not mean that the operation has
 * taken place. An attempt will be made to write the network data, but if the
 * socket is not available for writing at that time then the packet will not be
 * sent. To ensure the packet is sent, call mosquitto_loop() (which must also
 * be called to process incoming network data).
 * This is especially important when disconnecting a client that has a will. If
 * the broker does not receive the DISCONNECT command, it will assume that the
 * client has disconnected unexpectedly and send the will.

 *
 * Parameters:
 *  major -    an integer pointer. If not NULL, the major version of the
 *             library will be returned in this variable.
 *  minor -    an integer pointer. If not NULL, the minor version of the
 *             library will be returned in this variable.
 *  revision - an integer pointer. If not NULL, the revision of the library will
 *             be returned in this variable.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	LIBMOSQUITTO_VERSION_NUMBER - which is a unique number based on the major,
 *		minor and revision values.
